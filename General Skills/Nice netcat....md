## Description
There is a nice program that you can talk to by using this command in a shell: `$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 22342`, but it doesn't speak English...

## Approach
1. Run `$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 22342` to get a list of number.
2. The list of number is the flag in ASCII, so you can convert it into alphabet.
