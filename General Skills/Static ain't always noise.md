## Description
Can you look at the data in this binary: `static`? This `BASH script` might help!

## Approach
1. It seems we need to run the Bash script and take the `static` file as the parameter. However, we can directly search keyword in the `static` file to find the flag. As title said, Static ain't always noise!
