## Description
This [.tar file](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/52084b5ad360b25f9af83933114324e0/1000.tar) got tarred a lot.
## Hint
Try and script this, it'll save you a lot of time
## Approach
1. The .tar file `1000.tar` contains a `999.tar` containing `998.tar`... , so we had better write a script to extract them. like the python code below:
```
import subprocess
for name in range(1000,0,-1):
    subprocess.run(["tar", "-xf","{}.tar".format(name)])
```
2. Wait for about 1 min and we can get a png file in which a flag is.
