## Description
Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition http://mercury.picoctf.net:15931/

## Hint
Maybe you have more than 2 choices

## Approach
1. We can find that the method of `Red` button is `GET`
2. the method of `Blue` button is `POST`
3. So according this finding and the hint given, we can infer that we can send a request with different method to get answer. (According the title, it should be `HEAD`, lol)
4. Send request like this one in linux: 
```
curl --head  http://mercury.picoctf.net:15931/index.php
```
