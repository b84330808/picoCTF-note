## Description
My dog-sitter's brother made this website but I can't get in; can you help?

`login.mars.picoctf.net`

## Approach
1. By analyzing the JS code, we can find the code below:
```
return "YWRtaW4" !== t.u ? alert("Incorrect Username") : "cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ" !== t.p ? alert("Incorrect Password") : void alert(`Correct Password! Your flag is ${atob(t.p)}.`)
```
2. The string below seems a bash64 string, so decode it with bash64, and then get the flag.
`cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ`
