## Description
https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/33850/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:33850. Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!
## Hint
- There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this. I wonder if the users are kept in a database?
- Try to think about how the website verifies your login.
## Approach
1. By intercepting the `POST` request to server, we can find `username`, `password` and `debug`.
2. We can see the value of `debug` is 0, so just set it to 1 and the SQL will be outputed.
3. Set the `username` to `admin'--` to get flag.
