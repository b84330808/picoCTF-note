## Description
There is a secure website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/54253/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:54253. Try to see if you can login as admin!
## Hint
Seems like the password is encrypted.
## Approach
1. By intercepting the `POST` request to server, we can find `debug` and set it to `1` to see the SQL query.
2. We can find that the alphabet will be rotated 13. For example, if we want `or`, we have to input `be`. (it looks like `'` and ` ` will not be changed.)
3. Try `' be '1` and the SQL query will be `SELECT * FROM admin where password = '' or '1'`, and then we can get answer.
