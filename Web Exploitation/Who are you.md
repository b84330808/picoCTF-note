## Description
Let me in. Let me iiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn [http://mercury.picoctf.net:52362/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:52362/)
## Hint
It ain't much, but it's an RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616
## Approach
1. It said `Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!`, so just change your request header `agent` to `PicoBrowser`
2. And then it said `I don't trust users visiting from another site.`, so just add header `Referer` with value `http://mercury.picoctf.net:52362/`
3. And then it said `Sorry, this site only worked in 2018.`, so just add header `Date` with value `2018`
4. And it said `I don&#39;t trust users who can be tracked`, so just Add header `DNT` with value `1`
5. And it said `This website is only for people from Sweden.`, so just add `X-Forwarded-For` with random IP in Sweden, such as `2.16.66.0`
6. And it said `You're in Sweden but you don't speak Swedish?`, so add `Accept-Language` with value `sv-SE`
7. Got flag.
